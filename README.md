## Advent Of Code Challenge

This repo contains my submission(s) for [Advent of code - 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
The submissions are written in Rust, the one that I am actively learning ;).

Please note that the quality of code is NOT my number one priority but I try to write as good as I can while tackling the problem.
Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to iterate over each problem and improve the code.
But maybe during Christmas vacation when I get bored!

Therefore, there are also no tests present.
